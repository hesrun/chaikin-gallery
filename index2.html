                                        In February 2023 Konstantin Chaykin introduced the Smilodon,
                                        a new watch in the famous Wristmons, or "wrist monsters" collection.
                                        The idea for the watch emerged in 2022 inspired by the year's
                                        symbol in the Chinese lunar calendar, the tiger. Designing,
                                        refining and assembling the complex movement took the next year.
                                        On February 16 the master first showcased the new watch in action,
                                        during a presentation of his collection in Moscow.

                                        In February 2023 Konstantin Chaykin introduced the Smilodon,
                                        a new watch in the famous Wristmons, or "wrist monsters" collection.
                                        The idea for the watch emerged in 2022 inspired by the year's
                                        symbol in the Chinese lunar calendar, the tiger. Designing,
                                        refining and assembling the complex movement took the next year.
                                        On February 16 the master first showcased the new watch in action,
                                        during a presentation of his collection in Moscow.
